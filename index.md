# Welcome to my thesis

**Thesis overview:** My thesis focuses on the _Fucus distichus_ in San Francisco Estuary, looking at both its current status and how climate change could affect it in the future. To accomplish this there were two parts to my thesis: field work and an experiment. The field work took place at four field sites in Central San Francisco Bay with monthly surveys from June 2018 to Septemeber 2019. Population data was recorded in the field and samples were taken to be processed in the lab. The mesocosm experiment manipulated carbonate chemistry and salinity levels to study its affect on the reproductive output (oogonia) of _Fucus distichus_.


## Field work: Characterizing *Fucus distichus* in Central San Francisco Bay  
**Getting oriented: map and characterizing Central San Francisco Bay**
  - **Field site and bouy locations** [map](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/map_sites.pdf): We conducted monthly ecological *F. distichus* surveys at four sites from June 2018 to September 2019. Surveys were conducted at low tide once a month and at least three weeks apart between months. When we first surveying potential field sites, we referenced iNaturalist to see where *F. distichus* has been found. We picked four accessible representative sites to capture the variability of Central San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Field sites were located in Central SFE along the salinity gradient at Horseshoe Bay (37.83, -122.48), Brickyard Park (37.88, -122.50), Point Chauncy (37.89, -122.45), and Paradise Cay (37.92, -122.48). Each site has a monitoring buoy relatively close to each one so that we could characterize the salinity and temperature of each site.

  - **Distribution of *Fucus distichus* in San Francisco Bay** [map](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/map_pic.html), [Rmarkdown](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/interactive_map.html): Distribution of *F. distichus* in San Francisco Estuary was determined by downloading 299 observations of *Fucus distichus* from iNaturalist (May 15, 2020). iNaturalist is a citizen science platform where users upload pictures of species with linked GPS coordinated. Only research grade observations of F. distichus in SFE on iNaturalist where downloaded. I then assessed each photo and assigned it as “attached,” “wrack,” or “unclear.” I then mapped this database in a map on R (package “leaflet”).

**Opportunistic comparasion of 2018 versus 2019**  
  - 2018 vs 2019 *Fucus distichus* bed length [table](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/length_table_pic.html), [Rmarkdown](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/length_table.html): This was an opportunist comparison of *F. distichus* in May 2018 versus May 2019. In May 2018, I scouted Central SFE for potential field sites of *F. distichus* looking for dense beds of at least 10 m in length. When I found dense beds, I recorded the GPS end points of the beds and in May 2019 I revisited the same sites. I used the “measure” tool on ArcGIS online to convert GPS points into lengths along the shoreline.
