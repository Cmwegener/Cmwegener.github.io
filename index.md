# Welcome to my thesis

Eventually I'd like to have all my code, data analysis and figures here. This should make it easier for others to view. Thanks for checking this out!

**Thesis overview:** My thesis focuses on the _Fucus distichus_ in San Francisco Estuary, looking at both its current status and how climate change could affect it in the future. To accomplish this there were two parts to my thesis: field work and an experiment. The field work took place at four field sites in Central San Francisco Bay with monthly surveys from June 2018 to Septemeber 2019. Population data was recorded in the field and samples were taken to be processed in the lab. The experiment manipulated carbonate chemistry and salinity levels to study its affect on the reproductive output of _Fucus distichus_.

#### To do:
#### Map: field sites and bouys 
#### Table: length of _Fucus distichus_ beds in 2018 vs 2019
#### Graph: 2017-2019 Salinity profile of central SFE
## Mesocosm experiment
#### Figure: set-up and design
#### Interactive 3D graph: [reproductive output of _Fucus distichus_ under different salinity and pH conditions](test/try.html)
## Additional analysis
#### Interactive map: distribution of _Fucus distichus-_ in San Francisco Estuary
#### Table: comparative reproductive phenology of _Fucus distichus_

#### Notes on graphs
#### consistent color scheme
#### consistent labeling (dates)
