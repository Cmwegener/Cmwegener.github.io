# Welcome to my thesis

**Thesis overview:** My thesis focuses on the _Fucus distichus_ in San Francisco Estuary, looking at both its current status and how climate change could affect it in the future. To accomplish this there were two parts to my thesis: field work and an experiment. The field work took place at four field sites in Central San Francisco Bay with monthly surveys from June 2018 to Septemeber 2019. Population data was recorded in the field and samples were taken to be processed in the lab. The mesocosm experiment manipulated carbonate chemistry and salinity levels to study its affect on the reproductive output (oogonia) of _Fucus distichus_.


## Field work: Characterizing *Fucus distichus* in Central San Francisco Bay  
**Getting oriented: map and characterizing Central San Francisco Bay**
  - Field site and bouy locations: [map](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/map_sites.pdf)
  - Bouy data (need to add air temperature): [graph](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/bouy_data_all.png), [Rmarkdown](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/bouy_data_all.html)
  - Distribution of *Fucus distichus* in San Francisco Bay [map](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/map_pic.html), [Rmarkdown](https://cmwegener.github.io/thesis/interactive_map.html): Distribution of *F. distichus* in San Francisco Estuary was determined by downloading 299 observations of *Fucus distichus* from iNaturalist (May 15, 2020). iNaturalist is a citizen science platform where users upload pictures of species with linked GPS coordinated. Only research grade observations of F. distichus in SFE on iNaturalist where downloaded. I then assessed each photo and assigned it as “attached,” “wrack,” or “unclear.” I then mapped this database in a map on R (package “leaflet”).
